Android App Project Outline
"AniSpark"
Project Description: 

The Android app's goal is to uplift and encourage users by giving them access to a selection of motivational anime quotes. The app will offer several features that allow users to engage with these quotes in different ways.

Problem Addressing: 

The application fills the demand for a convenient source of motivation and inspiration. Especially for anime aficionados and those seeking a different kind of motivation, it provides users with inspirational messages through quotes from anime.

Platform: 

The application is designed for Android, utilizing Android Studio with Java and kotlin.

Front/Back End Support: 

Front End: Android Studio will be employed to develop the front end, which will be primarily focused on visual design, user interaction, and activity navigation.

Back End: This section will deal with modifying data, storage, and retrieval. The application will retrieve quotes, store them locally, and adjust the information in response to user input.

Functionality: 

Data Requesting: The program will pull inspirational anime quotes stored on the device.

Data Storage: The quotations will be locally stored on the device, so users can view them without an internet connection.

Data Modification: These features will be introduced to modify the data:

		The option for users to like their favorite quotes.

		An option to change how quotes are displayed according to the 
		user preferences (for example, just displaying quotes from 
		favorite animes).

Wireframe design: 

Users may start by filtering quotes. 

An interactive activity in which people can engage with the quote by liking it. 

An option for user settings or preferences that lets users personalize their interaction with the app. 

An overview that displays updated data, like a favorite quotes list showing how the user interacted with the data.
